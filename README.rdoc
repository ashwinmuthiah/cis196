This is the CIS 196 Application. Here is the link to the Heroku page: http://warm-dawn-7165.herokuapp.com/

The app is a polished version of what we have been building in class. It is a tasklist application, where you can keep track of things you need to do and delete tasks as you compelte them. You can also look at other people's tasks to see what other people are up to. After creating a tasklist, simply go to tasklist index to see your tasklists.

Functionality: Registering users, signing in and out. Creating and deleting tasklists. Updating users and tasklists. Viewing all users and tasklists. 

 Because I don't have much of an eye for design, the styling is minimalist but consistent. Gems used include LetterOpener, Bootstrap, Better Errors, and Devise. The Heroku add-on used was the one from class. Here is documentation for all the gems: https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener, http://getbootstrap.com/, https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors, https://github.com/plataformatec/devise. LetterOpener allows you to simulate sending emails to users. Bootstrap adds javascript and css to make the app look nicer. Devise gives you an authentication system.
